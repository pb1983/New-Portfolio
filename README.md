## Description

  Our second assignment of this bootcamp was to create a portfolio with vanilla HTML and CSS. 9 weeks, 20 modules, and approximately 280 lessons later, we've come full circle with an updated portfolio made with React. This project displays a handful of the applications that we've made over the course of the curriculum, as well as a dynamic contact form utilizing useState hooks. There are no separate pages on this site. Instead each "page" is a rendered component that is accessed without having to refresh the browser. In addition to using the React library for the first time, JSX syntax was used to combine HTML and Javascript into a single file rather than storing them in separate documents. 

## Installation

- Node.js - To download the latest version of npm, on the command line, run the following command: 
"npm install -g npm". Once installed, the routes can be accessed by typing "node index.js" in the terminal. 

- React - npm install --save @types/react
